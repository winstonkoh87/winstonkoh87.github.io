# Three-Pillar Leadership Framework

Leadership operates via three levers. Everyone has all three; the question is weighting.

## The Pillars

### ⚡ Strategy (Primary)

Outthink the environment. Focus on long-term optimization and asset construction. Identify the "Alien Truths" others miss.

### 🔥 Raw Power (Secondary)

Calculated force. Decisive execution when strategy is set. Ruin prevention via Law #1 enforcement.

### 💫 Warmth (Tertiary)

Selective charm. Building strategic alliances when rapport is a requirement for the objective.
