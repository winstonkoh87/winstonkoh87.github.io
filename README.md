## 🤖 Built by a Bionic Unit

> **This entire site was co-created with [Project Athena](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public)** — my AI-Powered Digital Personal Assistant.

### The Workflow

| Layer | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Human (Winston)** | Vision, strategy, taste | "I need a portfolio that positions me as a Strategic Systems Architect" |
| **AI (Athena)** | Execution, research, code | Scaffolded HTML/CSS, wrote copy, implemented particles.js, audited SEO |

This isn't just a portfolio *about* AI-augmented work — it's a **living demonstration** of the workflow itself.

### What Athena Did

- **Designed** the dark mode aesthetic, glassmorphism cards, particle constellation
- **Wrote** semantic HTML5 with accessibility (skip-links, focus states)
- **Implemented** interactive JavaScript (typewriter, particles)
- **Audited** the codebase for SEO, performance, and broken links
- **Generated** the og:image social card for LinkedIn/Twitter previews
- **Ported** curated documentation to [Athena-Public](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public)

### The Operating Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Human Intent (Top 1% nuance)   +   AI Scale (99% execution) │
│                        =                                      │
│                  1000% Leverage                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The human provides **strategic direction** and **high-nuance judgment**. The AI handles **research, execution, and documentation** at scale. Every conversation becomes intellectual capital.

> *"Athena is a digital extension of me. It executes in my voice, with my principles."*
