A personal portfolio website built with **Astro**, focusing on performance, component reusability, and zero-JavaScript defaults.

This documents how I built (and evolved) a complete portfolio website with AI-augmented execution using [Project Athena](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public).

## 📊 Site Overview

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Pages** | 8 |
| **Articles** | 14 |
| **Live Demo Sites** | 6 |
| **AI Widget** | ✅ Athena Live |
| **Framework** | Astro 5.0 (Vite-powered) |
| **Brand Kit** | ✅ Lambda (Λ) Identity |

## 🎨 Brand Kit

The site includes a complete **$10K-equivalent brand package**:

| Asset | Location |
|-------|----------|
| **Logo (Lambda Λ)** | `brand/logo/` — 4 variants (SVG + PNG) |
| **Brand Guidelines** | `brand/BRAND_GUIDELINES.md` |
| **CSS Variables** | `brand/variables.css` |
| **Email Signature** | `brand/collateral/email-signature.html` |
| **Presentation Template** | `brand/collateral/presentation-template.md` |
| **Invoice Template** | `brand/collateral/invoice-template.md` |
| **Business Card Mockup** | `brand/mockups/business-card.png` |
| **OG Image** | `public/assets/images/og-image.png` |

### Brand Identity

- **Logomark**: Lambda (Λ) — represents Athena, precision, the Λ+XX signature
- **Colors**: Void (#0A0A0A) + Bionic Gradient (#3B82F6 → #EC4899)
- **Typography**: Outfit (display) + Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono (code)
- **Personality**: Sovereign • Precise • Bionic • Premium • No-Bullshit

## ⚡ Featured: Athena Live Widget

The homepage includes an **interactive AI chat widget** that demonstrates the Athena experience.

### The Smart Mock Story

API integration with Gemini was too much hassle — rate limits, latency, key management. So we built a **Smart Mock system** instead: keyword-matched, pre-authored responses with simulated typing delay. Same UX, zero cost, instant responses.

```
               ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
   User Query  │  "What is Athena?"                   │
               └──────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                              ▼
               ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
               │  Keyword Match: "athena" detected    │
               │  → Return pre-authored response      │
               │  → 800ms simulated typing delay      │
               └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What It Does

- **Smart Mock System** — Rule-based responses covering ~20 common questions
- **localStorage Persistence** — Chat state survives page refresh for seamless UX
- **Reset Command** — `/reset` command allows users to clear cache and restart the flow
- **Dynamic Suggestions** — Context-aware follow-up prompts after each response
- **Graceful Fallback** — Unknown queries get a helpful "how to reach me" response

> **Future**: If usage justifies it, we'll add live API. The architecture already supports it — just swap the mock for a real fetch.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Framework** | **Astro 5.0** |
| **Styling** | Vanilla CSS (Scoped & Global) |
| **Interactivity** | Vanilla JavaScript (Islands Architecture) |
| **Build** | `npm run build` (Static Site Generation) |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions (Astro Build + Deploy) |
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages |

### Philosophy: Evolution to Astro

We started with pure HTML/CSS/JS to prove a point about simplicity. But as the site grew (blogs, components, layouts), we needed a **maintainable architecture** without sacrificing performance.

**Enter Astro.**

- **Zero JS by Default**: Ships pure HTML unless interactivity is explicitly requested.
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable `.astro` components for Headers, Footers, and Cards.
- **Content Collections**: Markdown/MDX support for the blog (coming soon).
- **Same Performance**: Still ~40KB initial load, but now with better developer experience.

We didn't sell out. We **leveled up**.

## 🤖 Built by a Bionic Unit

> **This entire site was co-created with [Project Athena](https://github.com/winstonkoh87/Athena-Public)** — my AI-Powered Digital Personal Assistant.

### The Workflow

| Layer | Role | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Human (Winston)** | Vision, strategy, taste | "I need a portfolio that positions me as someone who builds reliable systems" |
| **AI (Athena)** | Execution, research, code | Astro migration, component extraction, SEO audit |

This isn't just a portfolio *about* AI-augmented work — it's a **living demonstration** of the workflow itself.

### What Athena Did (January 2026)

- **Migrated** entire site from Vanilla HTML to Astro v5
- **Refactored** repeated UI into reusable Components (`<Navigation/>`, `<Footer/>`)
- **Built** the Athena Live AI widget with Smart Mock response system
- **Implemented** localStorage caching for instant responses
- **Designed** dark mode aesthetic, glassmorphism cards, particle constellation
- **Audited** codebase for SEO, accessibility, broken links
- **Cleaned** 230+ lines of duplicate code (January 2026 Audit)

### The Operating Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Human Intent (Top 1% nuance)   +   AI Scale (99% execution) │
│                        =                                      │
│                  1000% Leverage                               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> *"Athena is a digital extension of me. It executes in my voice, with my principles."*
